# Dashboard Changes Summary

## Changes Made
1. **Removed Staff Performance Section**: Completely removed the staff performance analytics from the dashboard that was showing individual staff metrics, grades, and performance ratings.

2. **Added Analytics Statistics Section**: Replaced the staff performance with comprehensive analytics that include:

### New Analytics Features:
- **Weekly Performance Summary**: Shows total orders, revenue, average order value, and top medicines count
- **Peak Hours Analysis**: Displays the busiest hours with order counts and revenue
- **Top Dispensed Medicines**: Shows the most dispensed medicines with quantities and revenue
- **Customer Flow Insights**: Provides customer count, average wait time, peak hours, and flow revenue

### Technical Implementation:
- Added four new analytics function calls: `getPeakHoursAnalysis()`, `getMedicineDispensingPerformance()`, `getCustomerFlowAnalysis()`, and `getWeeklyPerformanceSummary()`
- Improved error handling with `.catch(() => [])` for graceful degradation
- Structured analytics data properly to handle different response formats
- Removed unused CSS classes for staff performance grades

### Benefits:
- **More Relevant Data**: Focus on operational analytics rather than individual performance tracking
- **Better Business Insights**: Peak hours, medicine performance, and customer flow are more actionable for pharmacy operations
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Cleaner interface without performance pressure on staff
- **Comprehensive Analytics**: Covers sales, inventory, and operational efficiency

### Responsive Design:
- Maintains mobile-friendly grid layouts
- Uses appropriate color schemes for different metrics
- Scrollable sections for long lists
- Proper spacing and typography

The dashboard now provides more operationally relevant analytics while maintaining the same clean, professional appearance.
