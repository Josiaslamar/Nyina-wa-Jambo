# RPC Error Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified
- `get_medicine_dispensing_performance` RPC function returning 400 Bad Request
- `generate_sales_report` RPC function returning 400 Bad Request
- Missing `get_top_selling_medicines` function being called

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling in Analytics Functions
- Added try-catch blocks around all RPC calls
- Implemented fallback queries using basic Supabase queries when RPC functions fail
- Added console warnings instead of throwing errors that break the dashboard

### 2. Fixed Function Implementations

#### `getMedicineDispensingPerformance()`
- Added fallback to basic `order_items` and `orders` table joins
- Processes data locally to group by medicine name
- Returns consistent data structure

#### `getPeakHoursAnalysis()`
- Added fallback to basic `orders` table query
- Groups data by hour locally
- Calculates averages and statistics in JavaScript

#### `getWeeklyPerformanceSummary()`
- Removed dependency on non-existent `get_top_selling_medicines` function
- Added fallback to basic `orders` table query
- Simplified data structure to avoid missing properties

### 3. Dashboard Data Handling
- Updated dashboard to handle both RPC and fallback data structures
- Added safe property access with fallbacks (e.g., `hour.hour_of_day || hour.hour || 0`)
- Enhanced error logging with specific function names

### 4. Improved User Experience
- Dashboard no longer crashes when RPC functions fail
- Shows "No data available" messages instead of errors
- Graceful degradation with basic analytics when advanced functions are unavailable

## Benefits
1. **Resilient System**: Dashboard works even if some database functions are missing or misconfigured
2. **Better Debugging**: Clear console warnings help identify which specific functions are failing
3. **Consistent UI**: Users always see a working dashboard with available data
4. **Future-Proof**: Easy to add new analytics functions without breaking existing functionality

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test dashboard with admin and receptionist roles
2. Monitor browser console for any remaining RPC warnings
3. Verify analytics data displays correctly when functions work
4. Confirm fallback behavior when functions fail
